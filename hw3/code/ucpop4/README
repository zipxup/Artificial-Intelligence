________________UCPOP Planner version 4.0 now available!________________

Common Lisp source code for the UCPOP partial order planner, version 4.0,
is now available via annonymous FTP.  UCPOP operates with actions that
have conditional effects and universally quantified preconditions and
effects.  It accepts universally quantified goals.  In addition, UCPOP 4.0
allows domain axioms and predicates that call Common Lisp code to determine
satisfiability.  With a conservative search strategy UCPOP is both sound
and complete for this representation, but one can add aggressive,
domain-dependent search control with convenient declarative rules. Our
Common Lisp implementation is simple enough for classroom use, yet quite
efficient (requiring between 2-20ms to explore and refine a partial
plan). Version 4.0 offers the following improvements:

* A slick graphical Plan DeBugger (requires CLIM 2.0)
* Safety constraints
* Quantification over dynamic universes (object creation and destruction) 
* New search control strategies and improved search control languag
* Improved user's manual and more domain theories for testing
* Domain axioms
* Predicates expanding to lisp code
* Compared to version 2.0, version 4.0 is twice as fast at plan elaboration

One other thing.... I've recently written a tutorial paper (it appeared in
AI Magazine, Winter 1994) called "An Introduction to Least Commitment
Planning" for use in teaching with our planning software. The paper has
lots of figures and examples and seems to go over very well with students.
You can get it by browsing the UCPOP page above or my home page:
