# Artificial Intelligence 

HW1: finding the shortest path using Breadth-First search, Depth-First search, Uniform-cost search, A* search seperately.

HW2: choosing the next best stake or raid step to score the most points based on taking more steps (depth) into consideration.
     implementing with plain Minimax algorithm and Minimax + alpha-beta pruning algorithm seperately.
     
HW3: given queries and sentences in knowledge bases, justify whether the query can be infered from the knowledge base or not with resolution inference algorithm, full first-order version
