# Artificial Intelligence 

HW1: Finding Shortest Path

finding the shortest path using Breadth-First search, Depth-First search, Uniform-cost search, A* search seperately.

HW2: Stake & Raid

choosing the next best stake or raid step to score the most points based on taking more steps (depth) into consideration. Implementing with plain Minimax algorithm and Minimax + alpha-beta pruning algorithm seperately.
     
HW3: Logic Queries

given queries and sentences in knowledge bases, justify whether the query can be infered from the knowledge base or not with resolution inference algorithm, full first-order version. Converting queries into Conjuctive Nomal Forms with self-built expression tree.
